The image below is a screenshot from a zoo live cam. It was taken on January 15, 2023 at around 2pm local time.  
Please answer the questions below:  
  
a) In which zoo are these polar bears located?  
b) What was the temperature at the time of the screenshot?  
c) What were the exact coordinates of where the bears were lying down?


## Process
#### Locating the bears
1. I started with reverse image searching with Google lens.
2. I found a Facebook page containing a video of polar bears in San Diego Zoo
3. After comparing the original image, to the image of the San Diego Zoo, I knew this was the correct location.

**Location: San Diego Zoo**

#### Finding out the temperature
1. At first, I had no idea on how I would find out the temperature of the day.
2. I went to the previous Facebook post and saw a temperature in the title: 62 Fahrenheit. I assumed that is the temperature

**Temperature: 62 Fahrenheit**

#### Finding out the exact coordinates of the bears
1. I already knew which zoo the bears were located in. 
2. I opened Google Maps and typed in: San Diego Zoo polar bears
3. Maps lead me to Polar Bear Plunge
4. After some doing some comparing between the satellite view and the image from the exercise, I was able to locate the exact coordinates.
**The exact coordinates: 32.734487, -117.154595**
