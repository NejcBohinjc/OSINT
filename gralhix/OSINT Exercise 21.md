Maps can appear in the most unusual places. The figure below contains a chocolate bar featuring a map. Next to it you will find the satellite view of the same location.

Your task is to:  
a) Find the coordinates of the location seen in both images.


### Information gathered
- There is text on the chocolate that says: DO IT RIGHT 

## Process
1. I first did a reverse image search on the chocolate image, which showed me that the brand of the chocolate was Puchero
2. I then googled where the location on the Puchero chocolate  might be. I got these 2 results: El Castillo, Nicaragua and Castilla y León, Spain
3. Castilla y León seemed very similar to the image in the exercise so I tried manually searching the place but stopped because the area was to big.
4. After prompting chatGPT and providing an image in the exercise I got an answer of:  Hornillos de Eresma
5. I saw the Eresma river and noticed that it looked very similar to the one on the image. I re-positioned the view a little bit and marked the coordinates.
