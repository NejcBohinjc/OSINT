A Twitter user shared three photos of an event.  
Please answer the following questions:  
  
a) Which event is being celebrated in the photos?  
b) Which two photos were taken by the same person?  
c) The two photos mentioned above were taken in the same city. The photographer was previously in a different city. Find out the name of that city.


### Information gathered
- Location: Africa
- Festival of voodoo & dances
- Zangbeto dolls

## Process
#### Which event is being celebrated in the photos?
1. I noticed that zangbeto dolls are mentioned in the post
2. I searched what event features those dolls

**Zangbeto festival**

#### Which two photos were taken by the same person?
1. I really didn't know how I would find which 2 images were taken by the same person.
2. My estimated guess would be that both images that feature zangbeto dolls were taken in the same location, therefore by the same person.

#### The name of the city that the photographer was previously in
1. For this one, I used the reverse image search, and found a couple of posts including the exact image that we can see in the post.
2. I then clicked on a Facebook post with the image and saw that there was a comment saying: "Isese agbe waoo".
3. I Googled the "Isese agbe waoo" phrase and I got the results for a cultural event in Ondo State, Nigeria.
4. After some searching I found a post that says that the image was taken in the city of Ouidah, Benin 
5. I then found another article with the exact same image, saying that the image is in the same location.

**Ouidah, Benin**
